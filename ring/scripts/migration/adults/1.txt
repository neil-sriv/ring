Issue No.1 · Friday, November 10th

QUESTION 1: Sharika Menon asked: What have you been up to the last month?

Kanishk: I got a job (rip unemployment 😔) and I moved out of Austin :/

Chetana: School unfortunately BUT went to Austin a couple of times! Sam and I stayed with Sharika which was so fun <3. I got rear ended on the way back to San Antonio tho which is :(

pranali: I’m a plant mom now! they are all doing worse than when i got them, but they aren’t dead🌚
And I did my first power hour with beer not rage fuel… turns out its hell of a lot easier. Who knew?
I made buttercream and it split, but now i truly understand GBB

Sapna: The lowlight of my month was taking a long exam that I am pretty sure I ✨failed✨. I also attended a wedding in the woods which was very fun (see photo below with Saanika). I have also been taking tennis lessons which was the highlight of the month even though I kind of suck.

Sonia: This past month has been filled with a lot of good memories! I went to Dallas for tx-ou weekend and the game was super fun to watch. I also drove to Austin for halloweekend and my sister’s bday. I got to hang out with my family and see sam, chet, sharika, and kanishk on Rainey!

Then, this past weekend, arjun and kanishk came down to Galveston! I really appreciate them for making the drive to hang and for introducing my friends to ragefuel lol

I also just finished my class about the kidneys and am now in a class about the stomach/nutrition. Turns out I don’t really like learning about stomach issues but just two more weeks until thanksgiving break woo!!

Sanika Pragji: I've just been working and hanging with friends! I have had 4 weddings this past month and 1 family wedding! So I am also exhausted 😅

Megs: School! I just registered for sex therapy next sem so very excited abt that:) and other than that I’ve been spending time alone and with the fam…pls come home friends

Poorna: this month has been ROUGH. school is destroying me, but the semester almost done so its ok!! i spent last weekend in ny with my brother and every weekend before that dogsitting so tbh, not that bad of a lifestyle

Samantha: School has been really busy for me but I’ve been reading a lot. I just started reading ebooks which is game changing (I read 5 books last month). I went to Austin twice last month and those weekends have been my favorite of the semester. We went to Banger’s (not the same without everyone 😔), did a crystal ritual, and saw the solar eclipse through a cardboard box Sharika’s dad made. I also got to go home for a week so I played with Percy a lot and my dad cooked for me!

Sharika Menon: A lot more going out than what’s been normal to me since working LOL. Before October I was in my grandma era and going to bed at like 9pm💀 but people came up for Ajay’s birthday weekend and halloween weekend so it was fun seeing everyone :’)

I also went to DC to see some friends and the christian girl autumn vibes were so strong - I loved it. Lowk I was like “should I move here??” but I’ve been doing that to every city I visit these days🤣 Please send me ur opinion on where you think I should move in a year-year and a half or so. Cause I really don’t know.

Arjun: In the past month, I've traveled a decent amount to Houston and Galveston to visit friends and had lots of fun. But as a result, I got sick and probably have been sick most of the month LOL. Been playing old video games too like OG Fort as well as new ones like Spiderman (super good).

Rishika: school...school...club...more school...non-stop learning, non-stop grinding 😤
saw Daniel Ricciardo in a Red Bull car 😩
watched SZA absolutely slay at her concert 😱
made some really supportive and great new friends here (who woulda thought I'd be able to do it?!) 🤗
kinda, sorta slayed a few cold calls (also def bombed a few hehe) 😎
loved living in a new city (Nashie has already become such a special place and it hasn't even been a full semester yet!!) 🤠
missed BTS a lot on the rough school nights 😮‍💨
missed our crazy, chaotic, iconic UT weekends and all of y'all on the rough weekends 🥺

Ajay panda: I've been getting absolutely destroyed by this current unit in school, this literally the hardest class I've ever taken LOL, but I think most people in my class feel the same way so hopefully there's gonna be a fat curve at the end of the semester. On another note I broke my middle finger playing flag football so that been pretty annoying, can barely use my right hand to do any thing but hopefully that heal soon!

Neil: Texas Visit! TX OU :sad: ACL :happy: seeing lots of y'all :best: asthma attack + sick after ACL :worst:

Friend got a job at a boba shop in Oakland so I spent a Friday in East Bay coworking (playing cards), rock climbing, and eating sundubu jjigae

Went to a beach bonfire for Rishabh's birthday and we had to ask random people on the beach for lighter fluid and a better lighter to help start the fire...

Work has taken up most of my time, I been grinding a bit too much but probably gonna take it easy the next month hopefully

Corey Li: This past month has been very busy but very fun! October started off great with a housewarming and a Canada theme party that my friends hosted! After that, I began to prepare for my trip to Taiwan! While I did so, I continued hanging out with my friend group in SF consisting of UT and work friends. I also continued my art passion where I meet up with artists in SF and draw together. I've also been attending church groups weekly which has been great for meeting and making new friends as well.

The Taiwan trip itself was very very fun! I ate amazing Taiwanese food and spent time with my extended family. Both things I haven't enjoyed in 4 years. Traveling with family can be frustrating but its still nice to spend an extended time with them anyways :') I had a lot of down time and watched a shit ton of anime and read some books. I HIGHLY recommend Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow!!!

After Taiwan I had worst case of jet lag that I am still recovering from 2 weeks later... Halloweekend was chill and fun! I did a boardgame night with church friends that friday. The next day I went to a friends housewarming dressing up as cousin richie from the Bear. The party after that was a pumpkin painting party, Alamin and I made a Cowboy Bepop pumpkin.

The past week after Halloween was a bit busy... Celebrated my friends birthday at a farm upstate. Did a Zumba class! Did a drawing meet up. Played A LOT of Overcooked one night. I hung out with a friend this past Tuesday and went to another drawing event yesterday!

QUESTION 2: One Good Thing

Kanishk: Went to Galveston with Arjun to see Ajay and Sonia🩺

Chetana: There's this cat in my apartment complex that I am befriending!

pranali: been furnishing my new apt & it finally feels like home :))

Sapna: My cousin got engaged and I got to help set up the proposal which was very exciting 💍

Sonia: A small positive but I started playing volleyball again this month! It’s almost been a year since my acl surgery so I feel really happy to be able play sports again (:

Sanika Pragji: Despite being busy, I feel like I finally got the school, work, social balance down!! So I am very grateful for that!

Megs: I went to a group counseling thing for a class assignment and it was really good! It’s a virtual group for aapi and I think it was therapeutic so I might go again

Poorna: NY was so fun i saw some dsd friends on friday and then on saturday my brother and i watched harry potter and the cursed child on broadway and then came home and watched the AoT finale!! pls share AoT thoughts

Samantha: I started listening to Christmas music 🎄

Sharika Menon: I’m actually befriending my coworkers! I feel like during my internships I never put in much effort to make friends and I thought full time would be like that too but I actually kinda like the people in my rotational program. Like I go to the office just to see them.

Arjun: Been recently playing soccer more and going outside (I probably saw sunlight twice in the last year before this).

Rishika: My sister came to visit last weekend and it was so nice to be around family after what feels like FOREVER (it hasn't been that long but the homesickness go crazy)!! The workload has gotten quite intense these past few weeks and hanging with her was much needed :)

Ajay panda: Some of my UTMB friends and I booked a cruise for winter break to Mexico so im looking forward to that! Also Im gonna be visiting India this break so that'll be nice to see some family.

Neil: Had dinner and went ice skating with other new grads from my cohort -> lots of tea was spilled

Corey Li: Something positive that happened recently is... making new friends that are really into drawing. Its been fun getting into my creative passion and meeting people in person doing the same has been really rejuvenating :)
