Ajay panda: In 2024, I'm looking forward to starting to train for a 1/2 marathon which I'm planning to run in April! Besides that, I want to get more involved in doing volunteering and research on campus because the first semester I feel like the only thing I did was study

Rishika: ME = 1/6th LAWYER !!!
This semester was definitely the hardest thing i‚Äôve ever done (that‚Äôs what‚Äôs she said) and also a ton of my highest highs and some of my lowest lows but I‚Äôm so proud that I made it through ü§ó
(and i‚Äôm choosing to not think about how i‚Äôm gonna have to do this 5. more. times üòµ‚Äçüí´)

Megs: Being someone that looks good with bangsüòô like I genuinely have found the hairstyle for my 20‚Äôs and I love it so so much I feel so 90‚Äôs with it. But the only thing that sucks is my bangs get oilier faster than the rest of my hair:/
Also I learned this week that all of sanika‚Äôs bumble bff bestie friend group thinks I‚Äôm the coolest, artsiest, most musically eclectic girlüòù which I am but it‚Äôs nice to be recognized

Neil: Living in a 1-bedroom apartment in San Francisco

Ajay panda: Honestly, my biggest flex right now is just passing my classes haha this past unit.

QUESTION 3: How have you stepped out of your comfort zone recently?

Kanishk: I am trying to get more into playing sports. Started with Pickleball but hoping to start playing more basketball when the weather gets better. It's been a little sp00ky/frustrating playing with people who are way better than me, but I'm having a gr9 time.

pranali: Been meeting & talking to a lot of new people ://. I‚Äôve been back home for quite some time now, so I went to the dallas office to visit even though I didnt know anyone. It was incredibly bro-y but I‚Äôm glad I got to meet them (also got cava which made the experience so much better)! Also went to my cousins Christmas party with a bunch of over 30 year olds and tried my best to not stick to her.

Poorna: flew to amsterdam to see kavish for a few days and there was a decent amount of time when i wasnt with him so it was cool to do stuff on my own. not really thaaat big of a deal but ive never like roamed around europe alone before and i felt cool figuring out the public transit and going on walks by myself hehe

Image 1
Samantha: I've had a bunch of presentations for school so I've been forced to practice my public speaking, unfortunately.

Rishika: i‚Äôve gone to concerts that have all been amazing but are music genres that i normally would not listen to! being in ~music city~ has def helped me try so many new things and everyone is SO STINKIN TALENTED out here

Corey Li: I have! I recently started going to Zumba which has been pretty uncomfortable but its been super fun! I've been getting close with friends who've been doing it with me too.

Sapna: I am trying to cook which I never do but I made hot and sour soup which was pretty good!

Sanika Pragji: I am someone that gives 110% into any friendship, but I am learning to not give energy where it‚Äôs not reciprocated. Which is lowkey been a challenge lol because I never want to feel like I‚Äôm letting anyone down, but I have to do what‚Äôs best for me even if it‚Äôs uncomfortable.

Chetana: I feel like this whole semester has been out of my comfort zone!

Sharika Menon: I‚Äôm voicing my opinion more at work. I feel like I‚Äôve never been scared to share my opinion anywhere usually but the hierarchical structure of corporate America is ~scary~ or whatever. I‚Äôve also been asking for help more. I haven‚Äôt been afraid to ask questions or anything before but asking to lessen my workload was hard for me, especially in the beginning when I just started. But communicating my other responsibilities with my boss and team members more often has helped them understand where to step in when necessary.

Sonia: Honestly I really haven't, but maybe I'll make this a goal for the next month!

Arjun: I have not been pretty routined with the same things

Megs: I started going on walks through Katy Trail! Very big step since I hate being perceived but it‚Äôs really helped with my self-consciousness. I feel more comfortable taking up space which might sound weird but post-grad has really affected my self-esteem and how much I try to blend in to not stand out.

Image 1
Neil: I joined this slack channel that pairs you up with random coworkers for 1 on 1s every week. It's made up of mostly non-engineers so it's been nice to get exposure to other orgs in the company. I realized I hadn't been interacting with non-engineer/product/design people at work, so decided to do something about that.

Ajay panda: I went jet skiing in Cozumel this past weekend which is something I've never done before and that was really exciting! Me and one of my friends raced and we hit 60 MPH on the water which was insane!

QUESTION 4: Sanika Pragji asked: What are you working on in your relationships (with friends or with a partner) right now?

Kanishk: I am trying to figure out how to create reminders to respond to people on text (if anyone has any suggestions please lmk). Especially as we all get physically further apart, this is going to become even more important and we all know I suck at texting.

pranali: One of my friends recently said this to me and I loved how she put it so‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúFind in your self what you look for in other people. That way you choose to want the people in your life, instead of forcing yourself to need them. A super duper basic example of this could be learning how to do car things my self, so that when my dad offers to take me to the shop or do it for me, its an act of love not an expectation.‚Äù It makes you actively choose to have relationships and appreciate them.

Poorna: Hmm maybe just that I‚Äôm trying to be better about talking to people more often! Catching up with people helps with the school stress so much but I don‚Äôt really do it as much as I should :)

Samantha: I want to spend more time with my grandparents (:

Rishika: getting better at reconnecting! being away from people i‚Äôve been used to being around has def been hard but also has helped me evaluate my relationships and invest in the ones i want to! winter break is gonna be a lot of making up for lost time (working on charging up my social battery)

Image 1
Corey Li: Since I'm leaving in couple weeks from SF, I've been trying to spend time with my friends as much as I can, especially those I won't see for a while.

Sapna: I don‚Äôt really do this but I wanna try making more plans with people for the weekends to try out new fun stuff.

Sanika Pragji: I made a lot of friends this year and I had a lot going on work, social and school wise. I spread myself way too thin especially in the last 6 months. I have been working on setting boundaries which has meant saying no to some things and having to miss out which isn‚Äôt always the most fun but necessary.

Chetana: It was a little rough meeting people and making friends this semester, because school was so busy and there were so many new people it was overwhelming. But, I think I've found a good group of people so I'm just trying to get to know them a little better.

Sharika Menon: This is going to sound evil ü§£ but I‚Äôve been evaluating how much effort I want to put into certain friendships and doing less in friendships where I don‚Äôt feel reciprocation to the same level of effort I was putting in before. Like it‚Äôs no hard feelings to those people but I‚Äôve realized I don‚Äôt have to be best friends with every friend. I can have a friend where I only discuss TV shows with or a friend I only really try coffee shops with and that‚Äôs okay. I think it‚Äôll help me put more time and effort into people I am closer with and give me more time to myself (which I desperately need back)

Sonia: I'm working on spending more quality time with people! This semester has been a lot busier, so I'm trying to be more intentional about setting aside moments each week to hang out with those I'm close to!

Arjun: Being more intentional with telling people important things

Megs: With making friends in class it‚Äôs a little hard but I‚Äôve really been trying to be more myself and talkative early on! I made a couple more friends this semester through group projects but I‚Äôm always so astonished at how much older they are when they seem my same age.
With friends I already have and Neil, being more intentional. I thrive off of seeing people instead of calling or texting so definitely using find my as a way to keep up with y'all and make time for y‚Äôall even if you come home for a few days:) and with Neil just being very clear about where we are. We kind of started trying to call or ft with an intention set and being more compassionate if our intentions don‚Äôt align (calling for a reason or just to like spend time and do our own thing on ft). It‚Äôs been a little difficult since we often do not align but the communication is so so helpful in understanding how we both think and react. And honestly, I really want to implement this with friendships bc I‚Äôm always so worried when I ft before texting that I‚Äôm stepping on toes but I need to be more ok with being misaligned with friends and trying to find that alignment even if it‚Äôs for a quick 5 minute check in.

Neil: Being more response & communicative. I have so much trouble responding or catching up with my friends even though those are the people I'd like to talk to everyday. Pls just move to SF with me

picture: could be us but you‚Äôre not here

Image 1
Ajay panda: I feel like since I started med school and my brother started college at UT, we have become more distant just cuz we are both super busy, but I def want to work on that relationship now while we are on break, because I know as the years go on we will only have less and less time to see each other.

Kanishk: How I feel about y'all :-)


pranali: my roomie sent me this pic and said ‚Äú‚Äùvery likely i keep this one‚Äù, so everybody pray for me üôèüèº

Sanika Pragji: Friendsgiving!
